# Processing the Blockchain with Hadoop and Spark

Check out the full technical report [here]().
This project involves:

**1. Downloading the blockchain as of April 11, 2017.**
   * A sample, compressed blk*.dat file is in [data/blockchain_sample](https://github.com/nishilshah17/idsi_bitcoin/tree/master/data/blockchain_sample).

**2. Transforming the blockchain into a reduced, text format using Hadoop MapReduce.**
   * Code for this part of the project can be found in the [reduce_blockchain](https://github.com/nishilshah17/idsi_bitcoin/tree/master/reduce_blockchain) directory.
   * Sample output from this step is in [data/blockchain_sample_reduced](https://github.com/nishilshah17/idsi_bitcoin/tree/master/data/blockchain_sample_reduced).

**3. Using Apache Spark to run fast computations on the text data to uncover statistics/trends on the usage of Bitcoin.**
   * This code is located in [analyze_blockchain/src/main/scala](https://github.com/nishilshah17/idsi_bitcoin/tree/master/analyze_blockchain/src/main/scala).
   * Final results are in the [data/output](https://github.com/nishilshah17/idsi_bitcoin/tree/master/data/output) directory.
